                <p>A one-of-a-kind dining room should provoke intrigue and lead to conversation among guests. Whether it's through striking artwork, colors, or furnishings, it's important to craft a unique space that reflects the personality and lifestyle of the homeowner, while also ensuring the space is well designed. We spoke with 11 designers, who strike a balance between creative design and functional use when devising these unique dining rooms. Read on to hear their advice.Before designing a space, it's important to understand the function that it will serve. Will the space be used for formal dinner parties or casual gatherings? How much seating is required? Should the space promote intimate conversations or large group conversations? Does the space need to serve or store formal dinnerware? "Once you’ve answered these questions, you can start space planning and selecting the materials and pieces," says Giselle Loor Sugerman of B+G Design.“Small round tables are optimal for conversation and flexibility in number of guests," adds Barbara Eberlein, president and creative director of Eberlein Design. "Long, narrow rectangular tables maximize the number of guests along the perimeter but create a very different conversation pattern. Consider the type of environment you’d like to create."</p>
